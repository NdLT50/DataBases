Difference between UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY:
A PRIMARY KEY ensures that each record in a table is uniquely identified and cannot contain NULL values.
A UNIQUE constraint also checks uniqueness of values in a column or a combination of columns, but unlike a primary key, it allows NULL values.
Each table can have only one PRIMARY KEY, but it can have multiple UNIQUE constraints.


When to use a single-column vs. composite PRIMARY KEY:
Use a single-column primary key when one field (for example, id or employee_id) uniquely identifies each record.
Use a composite primary key when uniqueness depends on a combination of two or more columns — for example, student_id and course_id together uniquely identify an enrollment record.


Why a table can have only one PRIMARY KEY but multiple UNIQUE constraints:
The PRIMARY KEY represents the main identifier of the table and is used by other tables in foreign key relationships. Because of this, there can only be one.
UNIQUE constraints can exist on other columns to ensure that certain fields (like email or username) remain unique, but they are not considered the table’s main identifier.
