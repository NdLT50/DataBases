 1. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
	INNER JOIN returns only rows that have matching values in both tables.	
	LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
	If there is no match, NULLs are shown for the right table columns.

2. When would you use CROSS JOIN in a practical scenario?
   CROSS JOIN is used when you need all possible combinations of two datasets, for example to create a schedule matrix (every employee paired with every project).

3. Explain why the position of a filter condition (ON vs WHERE) matters for outer joins but not for inner joins.
	In INNER JOIN, ON and WHERE filters produce the same result because unmatched rows are excluded anyway.
	In OUTER JOIN, filtering in the ON clause preserves unmatched rows with NULLs, while filtering in the WHERE clause removes them completely.

4. What is the result of:
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2 if table1 has 5 rows and table2 has 10 rows?
 		Result = 5 × 10 = 50 rows (Cartesian product).

5. How does NATURAL JOIN determine which columns to join on?
	NATURAL JOIN automatically joins on all columns that have the same name in both tables.

6. What are the potential risks of using NATURAL JOIN?
	NATURAL JOIN can produce unexpected results if new columns with matching names are added later.
	It may also hide join conditions, making the query less readable and harder to maintain.

7. Convert this LEFT JOIN to a RIGHT JOIN:
	 SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.id = B.id
	 	Converted: SELECT * FROM B RIGHT JOIN A ON A.id = B.id;

8. When should you use FULL OUTER JOIN instead of other join types?
	Use FULL OUTER JOIN when you need to include all rows from both tables, whether they match or not — useful for finding unmatched records or merging datasets.
